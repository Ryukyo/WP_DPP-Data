# Challenge_DPP-Data

This script is a solution of Florian Fejer to the DPP data coding challenge

## Structure

- filter.py contains the script with the main method
- data.txt contains sample data and is the default file used by the filter script
- data2.txt is another file with sample data, which can be used to test the addition of a file path

## How to

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Windows 10 with Python 3.9

### Run the script

Within the folder containing 'filter.py' run the following command:
`python3 filter.py`

or to use a data file different from the default 'data.txt':
`python3 filter.py {path/to/data}`

### Run the tests
